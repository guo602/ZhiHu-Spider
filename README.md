This project uses  **zhihu_oauth**  python package coded by **7sDream**( Another NKUer ). After about 7days' try I thought this is the most convenient one I had ever  found  for **beginners** to grab things ( espacially answers ) on 知乎 . 

```python
python -m pip install zhihu_oauth
```

Before run __spider.py__ to get what you want，remember to custom your email/phone_num and password in __login.py__ and run it.

Enjoy your work.
